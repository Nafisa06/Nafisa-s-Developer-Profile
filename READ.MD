# Setting up a Developer Online Profile

## Description

For this week's assignment, we built our own developer portfolio page, to which we can add our future assignments and projects. This will come in handy when showcasing our skills to potential employers.

The new skills that were utilized for this assignment were flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables.


## Installation

The profile can be accessed through my GitHub Reposity via the following link:

https://github.com/Nafisa06/Nafisa-s-Developer-Profile.git 

The following link can be used to view the website on the browser:

 file:///C:/Users/asifa/bootcamp/homework/Nafisa-s-Developer-Profile/index.html#About%20Me



## Usage

The profile is currently empty and uses images and empty links as placeholders for future additions.


## License
The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).
